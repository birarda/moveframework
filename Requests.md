**No more request will be accepted because the project is no more maintained.**

# Fulfilled requests #
  * C# support
  * The framework works without a camera
  * Expose the the control of colors
  * MotionInJoy support
    * Works like a charm with version 3.1. Read the MotionInJoySetup for details.
  * Navigation controller support
    * Works only with MotionInJoy
  * Joystick and mouse emulation
    * You are not a programmer? No problem, just play your favorite games with the MoveFramework. ;)

# Requests that will not be realized #
  * Support for other webcams
    * The algorithm is optimized for the Eye, plus other webcams may not give the same control. So it would be really hard to support other webcams. The Eye is not expensive though. Not at all.
  * OSC support
    * Sorry, I don't know OSC. But feel free to make an OSC wrapper.
